I'm a PhD student in Organizational Behavior at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/). My first [research article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01902725241289880) about how reputation systems change the way we form relationships was published in Social Psychology Quarterly.
